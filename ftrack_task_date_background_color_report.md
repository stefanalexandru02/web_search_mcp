# ftrack Task Date Background Color Customization: Feasibility Report

## Executive Summary

This report investigates whether it's possible to programmatically change or set the background color of task dates through the ftrack API. Based on analysis of ftrack's API capabilities and UI architecture, **task date background colors cannot be directly modified through the ftrack API**. This limitation stems from the fact that visual styling in ftrack is controlled by the frontend application rather than being a data attribute that can be modified via API calls.

## Research Methodology {#research-methodology}

The investigation was conducted using:

1. **ftrack Developer Documentation Search**: Searched for API documentation related to task date styling, UI customization, and visual appearance modifications
2. **API Schema Analysis**: Examined available task properties and attributes through the ftrack API
3. **Frontend Architecture Understanding**: Analyzed how ftrack's web interface handles visual styling
4. **Community Resources Review**: Searched for related discussions in forums and GitHub repositories

## Key Findings {#key-findings}

### Primary Finding

**Task date background colors are NOT directly modifiable through the ftrack API.** The ftrack API provides access to data and business logic, but does not expose UI styling properties as modifiable attributes.

### Supporting Evidence

1. **No API Endpoints for UI Styling**: The ftrack API focuses on data manipulation (creating, reading, updating, deleting entities) rather than presentation layer customization.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: ftrack follows a standard web application architecture where:

   - **Backend API**: Handles data and business logic
   - **Frontend Application**: Manages presentation and styling

3. **Task Entity Properties**: Task entities in ftrack contain schedule-related data fields such as:

   - `start_date`
   - `end_date`
   - `duration`
   - `status`
   - `priority`

   But do not include visual styling attributes like `background_color`, `text_color`, or similar presentation properties.

## Technical Analysis {#technical-analysis}

### ftrack API Architecture

```python
# Example of available task properties through API
import ftrack_api

session = ftrack_api.Session()
task = session.query('Task').first()

# Available date-related properties:
print(task['start_date'])        # DateTime object
print(task['end_date'])          # DateTime object
print(task['duration'])          # Duration in hours

# Status can affect visual appearance but color is frontend-controlled
print(task['status']['name'])    # Status name (e.g., "In Progress")
print(task['status']['color'])   # Status color (if available)
```

### Why Background Colors Aren't API-Controllable

1. **Performance**: UI styling is handled client-side for responsive performance
2. **Consistency**: Centralized styling ensures consistent user experience across the platform
3. **Scalability**: Color schemes and themes are managed at the application level
4. **Security**: Preventing arbitrary styling changes maintains UI integrity

### Task Date Visualization in ftrack

Task dates in ftrack are typically displayed in:

- **Gantt charts**: Timeline views showing task duration
- **Calendar views**: Monthly/weekly calendar representations
- **List views**: Tabular data with date columns
- **Card views**: Task cards with date information

The background colors in these views are determined by:

- **Task status**: Different statuses may have different colors
- **Priority levels**: High priority tasks might be highlighted
- **Project themes**: Overall color scheme applied to the project
- **User preferences**: Individual user theme settings

## Alternative Approaches {#alternative-approaches}

While direct background color modification isn't possible, there are several alternative approaches to achieve similar visual differentiation:

### 1. Status-Based Coloring

```python
# Change task status to affect visual appearance
task = session.query('Task where name is "My Task"').one()
new_status = session.query('Status where name is "Review"').one()

task['status'] = new_status
session.commit()
```

**Benefit**: Status changes automatically reflect in the UI with predefined colors.

### 2. Priority-Based Highlighting

```python
# Set task priority (if priority affects visual styling)
task = session.query('Task where name is "My Task"').one()
high_priority = session.query('Priority where name is "High"').one()

task['priority'] = high_priority
session.commit()
```

### 3. Custom Attributes for Categorization

```python
# Create custom attribute for color categorization
custom_attr = session.create('CustomAttributeConfiguration', {
    'label': 'Visual Category',
    'key': 'visual_category',
    'type': 'enumerator',
    'config': {
        'multiSelect': False,
        'data': ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow']
    },
    'entity_type': 'Task'
})

# Set custom attribute on task
task['custom_attributes']['visual_category'] = 'Red'
session.commit()
```

**Note**: While this doesn't change background colors directly, it provides metadata that could be used by custom frontend solutions.

### 4. Notes with Visual Indicators

```python
# Add notes with specific labels or categories for visual cues
user = session.query('User').first()
label = session.query('NoteLabel where name is "Urgent"').first()

note = task.create_note(
    'This task requires special attention',
    author=user,
    labels=[label]
)
session.commit()
```

### 5. Custom Frontend Solutions

For organizations requiring custom visual styling:

1. **Browser Extensions**: Develop browser extensions that modify ftrack's UI
2. **Custom Dashboards**: Build separate interfaces that pull data from ftrack API
3. **User Scripts**: JavaScript injections (if permitted by organization policies)

## Limitations and Constraints {#limitations-constraints}

### API Limitations

1. **No Direct Styling Control**: ftrack API doesn't expose UI styling properties
2. **Read-Only Visual Properties**: Status colors and similar are typically read-only
3. **Frontend Dependency**: All visual changes must happen in the frontend application

### ftrack Architecture Constraints

1. **Security Policies**: ftrack's security model may prevent custom styling modifications
2. **Update Stability**: Custom UI modifications may break with ftrack updates
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Any custom solutions must work across supported browsers

### Organizational Considerations

1. **User Training**: Custom visual indicators require user education
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom solutions require ongoing maintenance
3. **Consistency**: Deviating from standard ftrack UI may create confusion

**Direct programmatic modification of task date background colors through the ftrack API is not possible.** This limitation is by design, as ftrack separates data management (API) from presentation (frontend application).

However, several alternative approaches can achieve similar visual differentiation:

- Status-based coloring (recommended)
- Custom attributes for categorization
- Notes and labels for visual cues
- Custom frontend solutions for advanced requirements

Organizations requiring specific visual customizations should evaluate their needs against implementation complexity and maintenance requirements. For most use cases, leveraging ftrack's existing status and priority systems provides an effective solution for visual task differentiation.

### Action Items

1. **Immediate**: Document current status color meanings for team reference
2. **Short-term**: Evaluate custom attribute implementation for additional categorization
3. **Long-term**: Consider custom dashboard development if visual requirements are critical
